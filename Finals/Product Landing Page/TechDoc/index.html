                <li>The course covers construction and design of dynamic web pages. The emphasis lies on standardized HTML and CSS to create structure and appearance. 
                    Validation of HTML and CSS code is done to verify that syntax follows the selected standard. </li>
                <li>The course also covers JavaScript to create dynamic behavior on web sites. Various JavaScript libraries and their use as well as how to
                     retrieve data from external systems via APIs are also included. In addition, the importance of ensuring that websites are accessible to 
                     all users regardless of the functional variations and the guidelines available to secure this is addressed. Also, how to create responsive
                      sites that work for different screen resolutions are included in the course.

                    <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages.
                        HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, and it introduces new features and improvements over its predecessors
                        It provides tags and attributes that define the various elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.
                        HTML5 also includes new elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, which help in structuring the content more semantically
                    </p>

                    <p>CSS is used to style and layout the visual presentation of HTML documents.
                        It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page.
                        CSS is applied either internally within an HTML document, externally in a separate stylesheet file, or inline within HTML tags.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior on web pages.
                        It can manipulate the content and structure of HTML, handle user input, and communicate with servers (Ajax).
                        JavaScript is commonly used to create features like sliders, form validation, pop-up messages, and more.
                        It can be included directly within HTML documents or linked externally.
                    </p>

                    <p>These three technologies (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript) work together to create modern,
                         dynamic, and visually appealing websites and web applications. As you progress in web development,
                          you'll likely use frameworks and libraries that build upon these core technologies, such as React, Angular,
                           or Vue for JavaScript, and Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.</p>
